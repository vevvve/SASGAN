# SASGAN


1.requirements

Pytorch == 1.7.0

To run the code, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3080 GPU video card with 10GB video memory is required. 

Software development environment should be any Python integrated development environment used on an NVIDIA video card. 

Programming language: Python 3.7.9. 


2.How to useï¼Ÿ


First, preprocess the image: Cut the porous media slice into 80 * 80 * 80 size pictures and combine into one tif. Then run the lowres.py to get LR tif as the training image.


Secondly, set the network parameters such as maxscalenum, batchsize, learning rate and storage location.  After configuring the parameters and environment, you can run maim.py directly.
